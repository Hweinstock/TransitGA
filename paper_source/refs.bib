  title={Human transit: How clearer thinking about public transit can enrich our communities and our lives},
  author={Walker, Jarrett},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Island Press},
  annotate={Jarrett Walker is a transit design consultant that has worked in many U.S. and international cities to improve and redesign their design. I hope to use his book and website to get an overview of the core concepts he looks at in all transit design problems, as well as specific examples of work he has done and what sort of data he uses. }

@book{ceder2016,
  title={Public transit planning and operation: Modeling, practice and behavior},
  author={Ceder, Avishai},
  year={2007},
  publisher={CRC press},
  annotate={This source dives into quantifying the success of transit systems and their mathematical optimizations. It has chapters on formulating objective functions and the types of data that should be used and collected. I plan to read a few sections of this source to get a better idea of how to quantify success in transit. There is a section specifically about applying max-flow algorithms in transit, which could be especially helpful.}

  annotate={This paper opens with a literature review of previous urban planning algorithms and attempts to solve the transit network design and frequency setting problem (TNDFSP). The paper also formalizes the problem and proposes a unique genetic algorithm approach via cyclic objective functions that could provide insight into more creative methods with GAs. I believe this source will prove to be very helpful.}

  annotate={This thesis provides a literature review of the field of transit system optimization as well as GAs. The author eventually proposes their own GA-based model on an artificial bus network to optimize total system cost under total system headway and 'slack time' manipulation. Also, note that this is advised by P. Schonfeld from earlier paper and he has other papers on this topic. }
